# Farmarama

This is a basic farming simulator game developed in Java.

The game in which you are starting a new life on your new country farm. You can buy crops and animals to manage on your farm. Where you need to care for your crops and animals to make the biggest profit for your farm.


### In this project I learnt a whole lot including:
- Project Structure
    - Being able to design a suitable structure for a project, including **creating relevant packages** for subsystems, including:
        - GUI
        - Game Logic
        - Testing
- Testing
    - Applying tested driven development and creating robust **Unit** and **Integration test cases**.
- Documentation
    - Integrating clear documentation using **JavaDoc** and by continuously writing readable and commented code.
- Starting from scratch
    - The process of planning and constructing a complete application (including a **Graphical User Interface**) from scratch.
- Project Management
    - The ability to minimize risk by **defining clear and realistic milestones**.
    - Tracking activities and the amount of work spent.

## How to run:
You can simply click the .JAR file to start the game or  start the game through a terminal (steps bellow).

### How to run the JAR file:

1. Ensure JDK 13 is installed on the machine.

2. Open the zip folder in a terminal window

3. Run "java -jar fdi19_jwr87_Farmarama.jar"



### How to load source code into Eclipse:

1. Select an existing or new directory as a workspace
2. Create a new project inside the workspace directory (File>New>Java Project)
3. After naming the project, press next and MAKE SURE TO UNTICK CREATE module-info.java before finishing.
4. Right-click on the source folder and choose (Import...->General->File system) then locate your source file. This will create a COPY of your files.
**Tip:** *If Errors present in the test package, add JUnit 5 library to the build path*
5. To Run the program, ensure to run from the EnviromentGUI.java class.

  
  
  

### How to run the Command Line Implementation:

1. Ensure the source code has successfully been loaded into eclipse

2. To run the command line implementation, run the program from the Enviroment.java class.
